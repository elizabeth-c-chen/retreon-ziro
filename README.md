# Retreon VS Code-style Color Scheme for Spicetify Ziro Theme

### About
My custom color scheme designed for Ziro theme for Spicetify. Special thanks to [@KennyGScott](https://github.com/KennyGScott/) and [@schnensch0](https://github.com/schnensch0/) for creating the original files inspiring and contributing to this theme.
- Color scheme designed to match [Retreon VS Code Theme](https://github.com/KennyGScott/vscode-retreon/) (@KennyGScott)
- CSS base file from [Ziro Spicetify Theme](https://github.com/schnensch0/ziro) (@schnensch0)
    - Minor bug fix for overlapping playback timer/buttons due to narrow window size
