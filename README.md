# Retreon VS Code-style Color Scheme for Spicetify Ziro Theme

### About
My custom color scheme designed for Ziro theme for Spicetify.
- Color scheme designed to match [Retreon VS Code Theme](https://github.com/KennyGScott/vscode-retreon/) by [@KennyGScott](https://github.com/KennyGScott/) 

- CSS base file from [Ziro Spicetify Theme](https://github.com/schnensch0/ziro) by [@schnensch0](https://github.com/schnensch0/)
    - Minor bug fix for overlapping playback timer/buttons due to narrow window size

## Setup 

### Linux/macOS
```
cd ~/.config/spicetify/Themes
git clone https://github.com/elizabeth-c-chen/retreon-ziro.git

spicetify config current_theme retreon-ziro
spicetify apply

```
